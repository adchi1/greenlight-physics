This is Katie Le, Alondra Cubaque Alicea, Ezinma Aguwa, and Ada Anya's FemmeHacks 2024 project
It's a web app called GreenLight Physics that makes introductory physics topic easier to practice.
In making this program, we used React and coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
We also left this project open to expansion because of all the creative possibilities!
